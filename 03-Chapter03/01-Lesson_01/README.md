## Introduction to Data Wrangling

There are roughly three steps in the Data Wrangling.

* Gathering;
* Assessing, and;
* Cleaning.

### Gathering

Gathering is the first step of a Data Wrangling, is also known as Collecting or Acquiring. The Armenian Online Job Post has 19,000 jobs postings from 2004 to 2015.

>Best Practice: Downloading Files Programmatically

This is the reasons:

* Scalability: This automation will save time, and prevents erros;
* Reproducibility: Key point to any research. Anyone could reproduce your work and check it.

### Assessing

The assessing in divided into two:

* Quality of the dataset
* Tidiness of the dataset
