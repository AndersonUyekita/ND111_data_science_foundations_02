# Wrangle Report

## Synopsis

I have found several problems with dog's name, probably the regex used to gather is not well calibrated, and in many cases has gathered articles, nouns, etc.. I have also found several problems with rating_numerator due to the lack of standard way to rate the dogs.

In respect to the data analysis, I have observed a seasonality in the frequency of tweets, the user @dog_rates tend to tweets more in the begining of the week, monday and tuesday specially, and i have also identified seasonality along the year, there are much more tweets in december and november, going in opposite way these two month have the lowest rating_numerator.

In regard to the algorithms used to predict the dog's breed, I have realized the three algorithms has results very distinct, after a visual investigation plotting a graphic without sucess I have used the Correlation Map to found my insights.

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to combine data set from Twitter (from the user `@dog_rates`, as known as WeRateDogs) and two other sources to build a new data frame, to do so it is necessary to perform the entire process preconized by the Data Wrangling, which will be describe in details in the next chapters.

## 2. Data Gathering

I have "downloaded" the files `image_predictions.tsv` and `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv` using the `requests` package. For the additional info from twitter I have used the `tweepy` package to access the @dog_rates tweets.

## 3. Data Assessing

The Data Assessing process was quite extense due to the many issues found:

|2|df_ach|Tidiness|-|Visual|source|HTML tags, URL, and content in a single column.|
|3|df_ach|Quality|Validity|Programmatic|rating_numerator|Invalid ratings. Value varies from 1776 to 0.<br>Data Strucutre must be converted from `int` to `float`.|
|4|df_ach|Quality|Validity|Programmatic|rating_denominator|Invalid denominator, I expected a fixed base.<br>Data Strucutre must be converted from `int` to `float`.|
|5|df_ach|Tidiness|-|Programmatic|doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo|This is a categorical variable and could be combine into one column.|

|7|df_ach|Quality|Validity|Programmatic|timestamp|Converted to date.|
|8|df_ach|Quality|Validity|Programmatic|tweet_id|Following the example of zip code, it must be string.|
|9|df_ach|Quality|Accuracy|Programmatic|retweeted_status_id|The same dog could be recorded twice or more in cases of retweets.|
