## Project Submission

In this project, you'll gather, assess, and clean data then act on it through analysis, visualization and/or modeling.

Before you submit:

1. Ensure you meet specifications for all items in the Project Rubric. Your project "meets specifications" only if it meets specifications for all of the criteria.

2. Ensure you have not included your API keys, secrets, and tokens in your project files.

3. If you completed your project in the Project Workspace, ensure the following files are present in your workspace, then click "Submit Project" in the bottom righthand corner of the Project Workspace page:

  * `wrangle_act.ipynb`: code for gathering, assessing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data
  * `wrangle_report.pdf` or wrangle_report.html: documentation for data wrangling steps: gather, assess, and clean
  * `act_report.pdf` or `act_report.html`: documentation of analysis and insights into final data
  * `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv`: file as given
  * `image_predictions.tsv`: file downloaded programmatically
  * `tweet_json.txt`: file constructed via API
  * `twitter_archive_master.csv`: combined and cleaned data
  * any additional files (e.g. files for additional pieces of gathered data or a database file for your stored clean data)

4. If you completed your project outside of the Udacity Classroom, package the above listed files into a zip archive or push them from a GitHub repo, then click the "Submit Project" button on this page.

As stated in point 4 above, you can submit your files as a zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each project in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.

It can take us up to a week to grade the project, but in most cases it is much faster. You will get an email once your submission has been reviewed. If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at review-support@udacity.com. In the meantime, you should feel free to proceed with your learning journey by continuing on to the next module in the program.
