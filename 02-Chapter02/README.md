## Software/Tool

Although this is not a requirement, I have created an account at Mode Analytics, it is the same tool used by the Derek (instructor) to teach SQL. Some good points in this tool:

* You can find the _Parch and Posey_ database available in this tool;
* You can create very good documentation about your queries;
    * There is an option to create Jupyter Notebook or a complete Report;
* Far better tool from the Udacity embedded tool;
* It is free.
