## Descriptive Statistics

This lesson is a kind of review.

### What is data?

Data could be whatever thing: Text, Spreadsheets, video, images, database, etc.

### Data types

* Quantitative Data: Allow us to perform mathematical operations with data (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.);
    * Continuous: Could be any real number (Age);
    * Discrete: Only integer number (Number of persons);
* Categorical Data: Used to label a group or a set of items (blue, yellow, red, etc.);
    * Ordinal: There are a way to put the categories in a scale (Very good, so-so, very poor);
    * Nominal: It is impossible to put the categories in order (blue, yellow, orange, etc.);

## Measures of Center

### Categorical

The categorical data is analyzed doing a simple summary to count the total of each category has.

### Quantitative

Four main aspects when analysing **quantitative** data:

* Measures of `Center`
    * Mean
    * Median: The median splits our data so that 50% of our values are lower and 50% are higher.
        * Even number of elements: single values.
        * Odd number of elements: average between two "center" values.
    * Mode: The mode is the most frequently observed value in our dataset.
        * No mode: If all observations in our dataset are observed with the same frequency, there is no mode.
        * Many modes: If two (or more) numbers share the maximum value, then there is more than one mode.
* Measures of `Spread`
* The `Shape` of the Data
* `Outliers`
