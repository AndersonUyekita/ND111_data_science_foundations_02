## Project Details

#### Analyze A/B Test Results {-}

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The data and the Jupyter Notebook, which are all of the files you need to complete the project, are provided for you in a downloadable zip file in the resources tab (as well as under "Supporting Materials" below). Note that portions of the notebook reference back to quizzes that are linked in this lesson to ensure you are on the right track.

Although the quizzes in this lesson are not necessary to successfully complete the project (though they are helpful), all of the items on the Project Rubric must meet specifications to successfully complete the project.

## Completing and Submitting this Project in the Classroom

How to Complete and Submit this Project
You have two options for working on and submitting your project:

Option #1) On the next page, "Project Workspace: Complete and Submit Project," you will see that there is a project workspace environment set up where you can do all your work on your Jupyter Notebook. This is great if you do not want to work on your local machine, or worry about system requirements. The environment will continually save your work.

If you choose this option #1, then you should also submit your project right from this workspace. You won't upload any files for your submission with this option, because the .ipynb file in the workspace will be uploaded by default. There are also directions at the end of the Jupyter Notebook there in the workspace for adding your HTML or PDF file to the workspace before you submit. That file will then also be included in your submission automatically.

Option #2) You can work on your Jupyter Notebook on your local machine. To do this, you should download the necessary project files from the Resources tab (the folder icon in the left sidebar here).

If you choose this option #2, please submit your project using the link on the last page of this lesson, "Analyze A/B Test Results," where you will be able to upload your project files.

You should choose one of these two options above - don't try to submit your project in both places.

## Check the Project Rubric

If you're on this page, then you should have completed the Jupyter Notebook, downloaded a .html copy of the document, and be ready to submit the report for review. If that's the case, congratulations! Read on to the points below for some final checks before you submit your project.

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this Project Rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. Your project "meets specifications" only if it meets specifications in all the criteria. If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, be sure to take some time to revise your work until you feel it meets the expectations in the rubric. In particular, there is one section of the rubric that focuses on the quality of your code. It is not just important that you are able to obtain the correct answers, but it is also important that you have followed good coding practices to obtain your solutions.

## Project Submission

This project will assure you have mastered the subjects covered in the statistics lessons. The hope is to have this project be as comprehensive of these topics as possible. Good luck!

## Gather Submission Materials
Once you are satisfied with the status of your Notebook, you should save it in a format that will make it easy for others to read. You can use the File -> Download as -> HTML (.html) menu to save your notebook as an .html file. If you get an error about "No module name", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using pip install <module_name> (don't include the "<" or ">" or any words following a period in the module name).

You will submit both your original Notebook and an HTML or PDF copy of the Notebook for review. There is no need for you to include any data files with your submission. If you made reference to other websites, books, and other resources to help you in solving tasks in the project, make sure that you document them. It is recommended that you either add a "Resources" section in a Markdown cell at the end of the Notebook report, or you can include a readme.txt file documenting your sources.

## Submit the Project
When you're ready, click on the "Submit Project" button to go to the project submission page. You can submit your files as a .zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each project in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.

It can take us up to a week to grade the project, but in most cases it is much faster. You will get an email once your submission has been reviewed. If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at review-support@udacity.com. In the meantime, you should feel free to continue on with your learning journey by continuing on to the next module in the program.
