### Simpson's Paradox

In this example lesson, you learned about Simpson's Paradox, and you had the opportunity to apply it to a small example with Sebastian, as well as work through similar example in Python.

In the lessons ahead, you will be learning a lot by following along with Sebastian, but it is really important to put these ideas to practice using data and computing, because that is how you will apply these skills in a day to day environment as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist.

It is so easy to get caught up in looking at full aggregates of your data. Hopefully, the examples here serve as a reminder to look at your data multiple ways.
