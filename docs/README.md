## Bookdown

This [Bookdown][bookdown] is a bundle of the notebooks taken along the lessons. I have decided to write this bookdown because it is more convinient for search and read.

## Bookdown Walk through

I have configured the [Github Pages][gp_pages] to access the `\doc` folder to render the website/book.

The folder `00-Bookdown` holds the entire bookdown, even the .Project file, .Rmd file, etc..

I have made copies (using a chunk of code in index.Rmd) of all content of the folder `\doc\00-Bookdown\_book` to the root of the `\doc` folder. I have read this [post][copy_file_in_r] to create my code.
