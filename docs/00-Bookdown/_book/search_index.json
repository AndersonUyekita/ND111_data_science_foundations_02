["sql-basics.html", "2.1 SQL Basics", " 2.1 SQL Basics 2.1.1 Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) This is a way to see (visualize) the relationship between different spreadsheets, in other words, how is structure a database. In a database, there are several tables, and each table has your own attributes, based on the cardinality they could interact with each other. 2.1.1.1 Entities This is a simple spreadsheet with information about anything you want, but keep in mind to: store new observations by rows and features/variables by column. This is a entity. My example is a table called Marks, which has mark id, student id, subject id, date and mark as attributes. The other column is the variable’s type. 2.1.1.2 Atributte An attribute is a feature we want to keep track. 2.1.1.3 Relationship Is a way to connect two tables. The line connecting two tables is a relationship. Remember, this line has some properties, that is named as cardinality. 2.1.1.4 Cardinality Cardinality represents a notation of how the information between tables will interact with each other. In a nutshell of Cardinality - Extracted from the Lucidchart Video. Additional videos with good content. Video 1 - Lucidchart Vídeo 2 - Lucidchart 2.1.2 SQL Introduction SQL is a Language used to manage this interactions between tables, allowing us to access the stored database. The meaning of SQL is: Structured Query Language It is very popular in Data Analysis because: Easy to understand Easy to learn Used to access very large datasets directly where is stored Easy to audit and replicate It is possible to run multiple queries at onde Almost do not have a limit of rows/observations Ensure the data Integrity, it is not possible to register a half child if you have defined this field as an integer SQL is very fast Database provide the data sharing, everybody could access the data simultaneously, which is good due to a standardization of database SQL provides also functions such as: Summation Count Max and min Mean, etc. Have in mind, probably we are going to manipulate data, and rarely updating or change values. SQL is not case sensitive, so the best practices is to write the clauses/staments in upper case. Best practices SELECT first_column FROM my_table Bad one SelecT first_column from my_table Bear in mind, the indentation is not a requirements but helps a lot to understand your code. 2.1.2.1 SQL vs. NoSQL Extracted from the class notes. You may have heard of NoSQL, which stands for not only SQL. Databases using NoSQL allow for you to write code that interacts with the data a bit differently than what we will do in this course. These NoSQL environments tend to be particularly popular for web based data, but less popular for data that lives in spreadsheets the way we have been analyzing data up to this point. One of the most popular NoSQL languages is called MongoDB. Udacity has a full course on MongoDB that you can take for free here, but these will not be a focus of this program. NoSQL is not a focus of analyzing data in this Nanodegree program, but you might see it referenced outside this course! 2.1.3 Clauses Tell the database what to do. 2.1.3.1 DROP TABLE Remove a table from the database. 2.1.3.2 CREATE TABLE Create a new table. 2.1.3.3 SELECT Is also know as query, is used to create a new table with the selected variables. You can use * if you want to select all columns. SELECT first_column, second_column, last_column FROM first_table; 2.1.3.4 LIMIT This is the same of .head() but this could only load a few lines to analyses the table. SELECT first_column FROM my_table LIMIT 1000 /* Will load the firs 1000 lines*/ 2.1.3.5 ORDER BY It is possible to order by in ascendant and descendent way. ascendant SELECT first_column, second_column, last_column FROM my_table ORDER BY last_column /*ascendanting*/ LIMIT 1000 descendent SELECT first_column, second_column, last_column FROM my_table ORDER BY last_column DESC, second_column /*descending for last_column*/ LIMIT 1000 This last query will returns: Last_column ordered by the highest to lowest; The second_column will be the lowest to highest. 2.1.3.6 WHERE Apply a filter to find a specific customer or anything else. SELECT first_column, second_column, last_column FROM my_table WHERE first_column = 100 ORDER BY second_column LIMIT 100 All staments possible to use. * &gt; (greater than) * &lt; (less than) * &gt;= (greater than or equal to) * &lt;= (less than or equal to) * = (equal to) * != (not equal to) If the argument of the WHERE clause is not a number, you must use single quotes. SELECT first_column, second_column, last_column FROM my_table WHERE first_column = &#39;Hello World!&#39; ORDER BY second_column LIMIT 100 2.1.4 Derived Columns Is a new column created from the query. It is similar to the mutate function from R. This is the operator to create a derived column: * (Multiplication) + (Addition) - (Subtraction) / (Division) SELECT id, (standard_amt_usd/total_amt_usd)*100 FROM orders LIMIT 10; Will display without a specific name (?column?). 2.1.4.1 AS If you use the AS the derived column will be name as you define (in other words “alias”). SELECT id, (standard_amt_usd/total_amt_usd)*100 AS std_percent, total_amt_usd FROM orders LIMIT 10; Best pratices: No capital letters, descriptive names, etc. 2.1.5 Introduction to “Logical Operators” In the next concepts, you will be learning about Logical Operators. Logical Operators include: 2.1.5.1 LIKE Using with WHERE clause could search some patterns. SELECT first_column, second_column, last_column FROM my_table WHERE last_column LIKE &#39;%ello%&#39; The % is called wild-card. 2.1.5.2 IN It is the same in Python or R. IN will be used to filter the dataset based on a list. SELECT first_column, second_column, last_column FROM my_table WHERE last_column IN (100, 200) This example will filter the rows of last_column with values of 100 or 200. 2.1.5.3 NOT NOT return the reverse/opposite. SELECT first_column, second_column, last_column FROM my_table WHERE last_column NOT IN (100, 200) This example will remove all observations equals to 100 or 200. Possible uses: NOT IN NOT LIKE 2.1.5.4 AND Logical statment usually to make some filtration. SELECT * FROM orders WHERE standard_qty &gt; 1000 AND poster_qty = 0 AND gloss_qty = 0; 2.1.5.5 BETWEEN Sometimes AND statment could be replaced by BETWEEN, this is much clearly to understand. BUT the BETWEEN is inclusive, which means the endpoints will be included in the filter. SELECT name FROM accounts WHERE name NOT LIKE &#39;C%&#39; AND name LIKE &#39;%s&#39;; 2.1.5.6 OR Well, this is a logical operator. SELECT id FROM orders WHERE gloss_qty &gt; 4000 OR poster_qty &gt; 4000; "],
["sql-joins.html", "2.2 SQL Joins", " 2.2 SQL Joins 2.2.1 Joins When a table is splited the performance to update or just to make a query is better than a big one. The reason is the quantity of data to read. This is one of the reason to split dataset in several tables, even more, sometimes in convinient to split because the type of data stored. The reason of JOIN is to “bind” two datasets into one. Here we need to use the period . (table.colums) to reference which column/variable we want to select. SELECT accounts.name, orders.occurred_at FROM orders JOIN accounts ON orders.account_id = accounts.id; The result of this query is two columns (name and occured_at), and to linked by the account_id and id. 2.2.1.1 Primary Key (PK) Is a columns with unique values used to map a variable. 2.2.1.2 Foreign Key (FK) Is a Primary Key from the other table. We use the PK and FK to link the tables. Based on the new information about PK and FK. Let’s insert a picture to visualize the database. Example of Join I want to Join these tables. My query: SELECT orders.* FROM orders JOIN accounts ON orders.account_id = accounts.id; What I need to realize: PK and FK always will be allocated in ON. FROM and JOIN each one with one table. 2.2.1.3 Binding three tables It is possible to “chaining” three tables. SELECT * FROM web_events JOIN accounts ON web_events.account_id = accounts.id JOIN orders ON accounts.id = orders.account_id In this case, I will import all columns, but I may want few columns. SELECT web_events.channel, accounts.name, orders.total FROM web_events JOIN accounts ON web_events.account_id = accounts.id JOIN orders ON accounts.id = orders.account_id 2.2.1.4 Alias Alias is a form to “short” the name of columns, the first method is using AS, but it could be simplified by only a space. Example 1 Select t1.column1 aliasname, t2.column2 aliasname2 FROM tablename AS t1 JOIN tablename2 AS t2 or Select t1.column1 aliasname, t2.column2 aliasname2 FROM tablename t1 JOIN tablename2 t2 Example 2 SELECT col1 + col2 AS total, col3 or SELECT col1 + col2 total, col3 or 2.2.1.5 INNER JOIN Returns rows which appears in both tables. SELECT table_1.id, table_1.name, table_2.total FROM table_2 JOIN table_1 ON table_2.account_id = table_1.id These last examples are all INNER JOINS, and will return a new dataframe (intersection between two dataframes). 2.2.1.6 OUTER JOIN There are two kinds of OUTER JOINs Left outer JOIN, and; Right outer JOIN. This two new JOINs has a property to pull rows that only exist in one table, it means some rows might have NULL values. The standard for this course will be to use only the left outer join. "],
["sql-aggregations.html", "2.3 SQL Aggregations", " 2.3 SQL Aggregations 2.3.1 Aggregations Functions This is functions return a single row with the aggregated value. sum; min; max; mean, etc. 2.3.1.1 NULL NULL is no a value, it is different from ZERO or a space, for this reason you can not use equal (=) to find it, for do so you must use IS. The NULL is ignored in all aggregatins functions, and it is defined as a property of the data. For the Parch and Posey dataset, NULL is equal to zero. WHERE something IS NULL WHERE something IS NOT NULL 2.3.1.1.1 NULLs - Expert Tip There are two common ways in which you are likely to encounter NULLs: NULLs frequently occur when performing a LEFT or RIGHT JOIN. You saw in the last lesson - when some rows in the left table of a left join are not matched with rows in the right table, those rows will contain some NULL values in the result set. NULLs can also occur from simply missing data in our database. 2.3.2 Functions 2.3.2.1 COUNT() Count the number of rows. If the entire line has only NULLs, this line will be noted counted. Simple Example: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM accounts; Example with filter SELECT COUNT(*) AS order_count FROM some_table WHERE any_column &gt; 100 AND any_column &lt; 200; Example with column selection SELECT COUNT(account.id) FROM accounts; 2.3.2.2 SUM() Perform the summation among rows. You must define which columns will be applied the sum function. SELECT SUM(poster_qty) FROM demo.orders; 2.3.2.3 MAX() and MIN() Return a rows with the minimun or maximum of a given column. SELECT MAX(poster_qty) AS max_poster_qty, MIN(standard_qty) AS min_standard_qty FROM demo.orders; 2.3.2.4 GROUP BY Divide the non-grouped column into groups, which means the aggregated function will be calculated by group. The GROUP BY always goes between WHERE and ORDER BY. Example 1: SELECT a.name, o.occurred_at FROM accounts a JOIN orders o ON a.id = o.account_id ORDER BY o.occurred_at LIMIT 1; Same example but indexing by number: SELECT a.name, o.occurred_at FROM accounts a JOIN orders o ON a.id = o.account_id ORDER BY 2 LIMIT 1; OBS.: The index used in ORDER BY clause is to refence o.occurred_at. 2.3.2.5 DISTINCT DISTINCT is always used in SELECT statements, and it provides the unique rows for all columns written in the SELECT statement. Therefore, you only use DISTINCT once in any particular SELECT statement. SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3 FROM table1; 2.3.2.6 HAVING HAVING is the “clean” way to filter a query that has been aggregated, but this is also commonly done using a subquery. Essentially, any time you want to perform a WHERE on an element of your query that was created by an aggregate, you need to use HAVING instead. Note extracted from the class notes. SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts FROM accounts a JOIN sales_reps s ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id GROUP BY s.id, s.name HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 5 ORDER BY num_accounts; 2.3.3 DATE To GROUP BY a date is quite complicated because each time is (obviously) different, for this, reason is necessary to “round” the time/date to group them. 2.3.3.1 DATE_TRUNC Common trunctions are: day; month, and; year. Sintaxe: DATE_TRUNC(‘[interval]’, time_column) Where: microsecond millisecond second minute hour day week month quarter year century decade millenium For further explanaition about date SELECT demo.accounts.name, DATE_TRUNC(&#39;month&#39;, demo.orders.occurred_at) AS year_month, SUM(demo.orders.gloss_amt_usd) AS sum_gloss_usd FROM demo.orders JOIN demo.accounts ON demo.orders.account_id = demo.accounts.id WHERE demo.accounts.name = &#39;Walmart&#39; GROUP BY year_month, demo.accounts.name ORDER BY sum_gloss_usd DESC LIMIT 1; 2.3.3.2 DATE PART Extract part of the date 2.3.4 CASE Create a new column, derivate column, with a kind classification (assign a value into this new column according to the statment). SELECT account_id, occurred_at, total, CASE WHEN total &gt; 500 THEN &#39;Over 500&#39; WHEN total &gt; 300 AND total &lt;= 500 THEN &#39;301 - 500&#39; WHEN total &gt; 100 AND total &lt;= 300 THEN &#39;101 - 300&#39; ELSE &#39;100 or under&#39; END AS total_group FROM demo.orders LIMIT 10; Creates the total_group column. 2.3.4.1 With AGGREGATION Combining the CASE clause with aggregations function could be a power tool, because the WHERE clause only evaluate one statement, using WHEN CASE it is possible to evaluate several staments. SELECT demo.orders.account_id, demo.orders.total_amt_usd, CASE WHEN demo.orders.total_amt_usd &gt;= 3000 THEN &#39;Large&#39; ELSE &#39;Small&#39; END AS level FROM demo.orders LIMIT 10; "],
["sql-subqueries-temporary-tables-advanced.html", "2.4 SQL Subqueries &amp; Temporary Tables (Advanced)", " 2.4 SQL Subqueries &amp; Temporary Tables (Advanced) 2.4.1 Subqueries This is a way to nest queries, it means: The result of one query will be used as FROM to the next query. SELECT * FROM(SELECT something FROM interesting) AS table_1 In the example above, I have one query nested to another. Bear in mind, I must give a alias to the nested query. If the result of the subquery is a single value, you are allowed to insert this subquery wherever you want. 2.4.2 WITH Also known as Common Table Expression (CTE), is a kinf of subquery but could be more helpful if someone is going to read the code. Due to the possibility to write the code in fragments an assign name, this is very handy. Example WITH my_with_example AS (SELECT ... MY CODE) SELECT something FROM my_with_example As you can see it provide a better way to code because the code became more readable. "],
["data-cleaning-advanced.html", "2.5 Data Cleaning (Advanced)", " 2.5 Data Cleaning (Advanced) 2.5.1 Data Cleaning 2.5.1.1 LEFT and RIGHT It is the same of Excel functions. SELECT LEFT(2, something) AS lefty_part_of_simething FROM interesting The example above will create a new column with the first two, from the left to right, character of something. SELECT RIGHT(2, something) AS lefty_part_of_simething FROM interesting Almost the same, but start from the right to the left. 2.5.1.2 LEN Returns the string length. SELECT LEN(something) FROM interesting 2.5.1.3 POSITION and STRPOS POSITION will find a pattern in the string and will return the position (from the left to the right). SELECT POSITION(&#39;,&#39;, something) /*Looking for a coma*/ FROM interesting The STRPOS has the same use and same results. SELECT STRPOS(something, &#39;,&#39;) /*Looking for a coma*/ FROM interesting Both functions are case sensitive. 2.5.1.4 LOWER and UPPER Converts string into all lower or all upper cases. SELECT LOWER(something) FROM interesting 2.5.1.5 CONCAT Bind/Combine/Concatenate strings (in different) columns into a new column. Example 1 SELECT CONCAT(first_name, &#39; &#39;,last_name) AS complete_name /* The &#39; &#39; is the space between strings*/ FROM interesting You can use ||. Example 2 SELECT first_name || &#39; &#39; || last_name AS complete_name /* The &#39; &#39; is the space between strings*/ FROM interesting 2.5.1.6 CAST CAST allow to convert one type to another. Example 1 SELECT CAST(year || month || day AS date) AS formatted_date FROM interesting The same of Example 1, but with a different notation to CAST clause. Example 2: SELECT (year || month || day AS date)::date AS formatted_date FROM interesting CAST is useful to converter strings into numbers or dates. 2.5.1.7 COALESCE Converts NULL fields into Zero.

["introduction-to-data-wrangling.html", "3.1 Introduction to Data Wrangling", " 3.1 Introduction to Data Wrangling There are roughly three steps in the Data Wrangling. Gathering; Assessing, and; Cleaning. This is a iterate process between these three steps. Data wrangling is about gathering the right pieces of data, assessing your data’s quality and structure, then modifying your data to make it clean. But the assessments you make and convert to cleaning operations won’t make your analysis, viz, or model better, though. The goal is to just make them possible, i.e., functional. EDA is about exploring your data to later augment it to maximize the potential of our analyses, visualizations, and models. When exploring, simple visualizations are often used to summarize your data’s main characteristics. From there you can do things like remove outliers and create new and more descriptive features from existing data, also known as feature engineering. Or detect and remove outliers so your model’s fit is better. ETL: You also may have heard of the extract-transform-load process also known as ETL. ETL differs from data wrangling in three main ways: * The users are different * The data is different * The use cases are different This article (Data Wrangling Versus ETL: What’s the Difference?) by Wei Zhang explains these three differences well. All text extracted from the class notes. 3.1.1 Gathering Gathering is the first step of a Data Wrangling, is also known as Collecting or Acquiring. The Armenian Online Job Post has 19,000 jobs postings from 2004 to 2015. Best Practice: Downloading Files Programmatically This is the reasons: Scalability: This automation will save time, and prevents erros; Reproducibility: Key point to any research. Anyone could reproduce your work and check it. 3.1.2 Assessing The assessing in divided into two mains aspects: Quality of the dataset Tidiness of the dataset 3.1.2.1 Quality Low quality dataset is related to a dirty dataset, which means the content quality of data. Commom issues: Missing values Non standard units (km, meters, inches, etc. all mixed) Innacurate data, invalid data, inconsistent data, etc. One dataset may be high enough quality for one application but not for another. 3.1.2.2 Tidiness Untidy data or messy data, is about the structure of the dataset. Each obsevation by rows, and; Each variable/features by column. This is the Hadley Wickham definition of tidy data. 3.1.3 Assessing the data There are two ways to assess the data. Visual, and; Programmatic. 3.1.3.1 Visual Assessment Using regular tools, such as Graphics, Excel, tables, etc. It means, there is a human assessing the data. 3.1.3.2 Programmatic Assessment Using automation to dataset evaluation is scalable, and allows you to handle a very huge quantity of data. Examples of “Programmatic Assessment”: Analysing the data using .info(), .head(), .describe(), plotting graphics (.plot()), etc.. Bear in mind, in this step we do not use “verbs” to describe any erros/problem, because the “verbs” will be actions to the next step. 3.1.4 Cleaning Improving the quality of a dataset or cleaning the dataset do not means: Changing the data (because it could be data fraud). The meaning of Cleaning is correcting the data or removing the data. Innacurate, wrong or irrelevant data. Replacing or filling (NULL or NA values) data. Combining/Merging datasets. Improving the tidiness is transform the dataset to follow: each observation = row each variable = column There are two ways to cleaning the data: manually and programmatic. 3.1.4.1 Manually To be avoided. 3.1.4.2 Programmatic There are three steps: Define Code Test Defining means defining a data cleaning plan in writing, where we turn our assessments into defined cleaning tasks. This plan will also serve as an instruction list so others (or us in the future) can look at our work and reproduce it. Coding means translating these definitions to code and executing that code. Testing means testing our dataset, often using code, to make sure our cleaning operations worked. Text from the class notes. "],
["data-gathering.html", "3.2 Data Gathering", " 3.2 Data Gathering This is the first step of any Data Wrangling, sometimes this process is a bit complicated because you need to find these data (probably from different sources and then merge). 3.2.1 Flat File This is the way to store data into a single text file, usually, this file has another extension (.csv, tsv, etc.), each one of this extension has your own characteristic. Each variable/features is separated by a comma and each row is an observation; Each variable/features is separated by a tab and each row is an observation. There are some advantages for using the flat files. Anyone could read, even a human; Is lightweight; You do not need to install a specific software; Simple to understand (each variable is delimited by a coma/tab); Any software could open it; Very good to small dataset. But has disadvantages also: Do not have standard; Do not have data integrity checks; Duplicated rows; You can record any value in any field; Not great to large datasets. 3.2.1.0.1 Importing the tsv file I have used the read_csv to load the data, but I have set the sep argument as \\t, which means tabular. Sometimes, the flat files use ; or ,, so it is necessary to define what is the delimiter. Example: import pandas as pd df = pd.read_cvs(&#39;bestofrt.tsv&#39;, sep= &#39;\\t&#39;) 3.2.2 Web Scraping This is terminology is used to say the data extracted from a website (usually using code to do it). Due to this code depends on the HTML file, if any change of the website happens, all the code used to web scrapping could stopping to working properly, which requires an adjustments. For this reason, web scraping is not a definitive solution. 3.2.3 HTTP Request This is useful to access archives from the internet, combining with the OS package, it is possible to download and store locally the file. 3.2.4 Encoding and Character Set This explanation is based on this Stack Overflow thread. Encoding: Is a proccess to convert a something into bytes. Audio is encoded into MP3, WAV, etc. Images is encoded into PNG, JPG, TIFF, etc. Text files is enconded into ASCII, UTF-8, etc. The Character Set is as the name, is a set of charaters which I can use to write a phrase, each character has a code which represents the letter/character. There are several character set such as ASCII and UTF-8. 3.2.5 Application Programming Interfaces - API The API let you access the data from the internet in a resonable easy manner. There are several API available in the internet for many social media: Facebook; Instagram; Twitter, etc.; This lesson will use the Mediawiki, which is a Open Source API to Wikipedia. Most of the file from the API are formated as JSON or XML. 3.2.6 JSON and XML JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation and XML for Extensible Markup Language. Sometimes the regular tabular way to structure the data is not a good solution, and for this reason, there are other forms to store data as JSON and XML. They use a kind of “dictionary” to store data, which allows storing more than one information per variable. There are some similarities in JSON and Python: JSON Array = Python list JSON Object = Python dictonary 3.2.7 Methods in this Lesson 3.2.7.1 .find() This method is used to find tags and containers. Example: soup.find(&#39;title&#39;) This code above will find the tag title, and return the content. 3.2.7.2 .find_all() It is almost the same of .find(), but will find in all document the given pattern.

Even number of elements: single values. Odd number of elements: average between two “center” values. Mode: The mode is the most frequently observed value in our dataset. No mode: If all observations in our dataset are observed with the same frequency, there is no mode. Many modes: If two (or more) numbers share the maximum value, then there is more than one mode.

["quantitative-data.html", "4.2 Quantitative Data", " 4.2 Quantitative Data 4.2.1 Measures of Spread How far are points from one another. Common values of spread: Range; Interquartile range (IQR); Standard Deviation, and; Variance. 4.2.1.1 Histogram Figure 1 shows an example of histogram. This is a way to visualize the quantitative data. 4.2.2 Five Number Summary These are the number: Maximum; Third quartile or Q3 (75%); Second quartile (it is the same of mean) or Q2 (or 50%); First quartile or Q1 (25%), and; Minimum. First step to do is order the values, as you can see in Figure 2 (odd set of values). As you can see, Q1 and Q3 are the median of the data on either sides of Q2. The range is defined as: \\[ \\text{Range} = maximum - minimum \\tag{1}\\] The Interquartile is define as: \\[ \\text{Interquartile} = Q3 - Q1 \\tag{2}\\] For a even set of values I need to calculate the “average” of two values. 4.2.2.1 Boxplot The boxplot graphic is a way to visualize the spread of the data. It could be useful for quickly comparing the spread of two data sets. Based on the Figure 4, the graphic on the right shows that in the weekends the number of dogs varies much more than on weekdays (looking to the range). 4.2.3 Standard Deviation Meaning: On average, how much each point varies from the mean of the points. First, I need to define the “distance” between mean and each observation. “Distance” could be interpreted as the difference of these two values. The issue observed in this difference are positive and negative values. For this reason, the square is used to turn everything positive (because later I can square root). Standard Deviation is frequently used to compare spread of different groups. Having higher standard deviation is associated with having higher risk. \\[ \\text{Standard Deviation} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n (\\bar x - x_i)^2 \\tag{3}\\] 4.2.4 Shape The shape is related to the histogram form, Figure 5 shows an example. Left Skewed is pulled to the “begining” median stays close to the mode GPA, Age of death, Asset price changes Simmetric (example: Normal distribution or bell curve) mean = median = mode; Examples: heights, weights, scores, precipitation, etc. Right Skewed mean is pulled to the tail median stays close to the mode Amount of drug left in your bloodstream over time, distribution of wealth, human athletic abilities. Side note: If you aren’t sure if your data are normally distributed, there are plots called normal quantile plots and statistical methods like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test that are aimed to help you understand whether or not your data are normally distributed. Implementing this test is beyond the scope of this class, but can be used as a fun fact. 4.2.5 Outliers Data points thah fall very far from the rest of the values in our dataset. The “very far” is quite generic and could be interpreted in many forms. One way to visualize it is plotting a histogram, as you can see in Figure 6. Note they exist and the impact on summary Statistics If typo, remove or fix it. Understand why they exist, and the impact on questions we are trying to answer Reporting the 5 number summary is better than mean and standard deviation when outliers are present Be careful in reporting know how to ask the right questions 4.2.6 Descriptive vs Inferential Descriptive Statistics: Describing Collected Data Inferential Statistics: Drawing conclusions about a population based on data collected from sample of individuals from that population.

In probability theory and statistics, the Bernoulli distribution, named after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, is the discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability \\({\\displaystyle p}\\) and the value 0 with probability \\({\\displaystyle q=1-p,}\\) that is, the probability distribution of any single experiment that asks a yes–no question; the question results in a boolean-valued outcome, a single bit of information whose value is success/yes/true/one with probability p and failure/no/false/zero with probability q. It can be used to represent a (possibly biased) coin toss where 1 and 0 would represent “heads” and “tails” (or vice versa), respectively, and p would be the probability of the coin landing on heads or tails, respectively. In particular, unfair coins would have \\({\\displaystyle p\\neq 1/2.}\\) The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution where a single trial is conducted (so n would be 1 for such a binomial distribution). It is also a special case of the two-point distribution, for which the possible outcomes need not be 0 and 1. – Wikipedia Rede more in wolfram. 4.4.2.1 Summary Here you learned some fundamental rules of probability. Using notation, we could say that the outcome of a coin flip could either be T or H for the event that the coin flips tails or heads, respectively. Then the following rules are true: Probability of a Event &gt; \\[\\bold{P(H)} = 0.5\\] Probability of opposite event &gt; \\[\\bold{1 - P(H) = P(\\text{not H})} = 0.5\\] where \\(\\bold{\\text{not H}}\\) is the event of anything other than heads. Since, there are only two possible outcomes, we have that \\(\\bold{P(\\text{not H}) = P(T)} = 0.5\\). In later concepts, you will see this with the following notation: \\(\\bold{\\lnot H}\\). Probability of composite event \\[ P * P * P * \\dots * P \\] It is only true because the events are independent of one another, which means the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of another. Across multiple coin flips, we have the probability of seeing n heads as \\(\\bold{P(H)^n}\\). This is because these events are independent. We can get two generic rules from this: The probability of any event must be between 0 and 1, inclusive. The probability of the compliment event is 1 minus the probability of an event. That is the probability of all other possible events is 1 minus the probability an event itself. Therefore, the sum of all possible events is equal to 1. If our events are independent, then the probability of the string of possible events is the product of those events. That is the probability of one event AND the next AND the next event, is the product of those events. 4.4.2.2 Looking Ahead You will be working with the Binomial Distribution, which creates a function for working with coin flip events like the first events in this lesson. These events are independent, and the above rules will hold. from Text: Recap + Next Steps "],

Have in mind, these two birds has different probability to run on the morning. The early bird has 0.02; The night owl has 0.00. 4.5.1 Medical Example Supose a patient with a disease, the probability of this patient has cancer is 0.9 and to be free cancer is 0.1. \\[P(cancer) = 0.1 \\\\ P(\\neg \\ cancer) = 0.9 \\tag{1}\\] To be honest, we do not know if this patient has cancer, so it is necessary to apply a test. This test is not perfect, it means, there are a probability to indicates a false positive and a false negative. For this reason, I introduce the conditional probability. \\[ P(Positive | cancer) = 0.9 \\tag{2}\\] What is the meaning of this notation? Given the patient has cancer, the probability of this test indicates positive is 0.9.

Often events are not independent like with coin flips and dice rolling. Instead, the outcome of one event depends on an earlier event. For example, the probability of obtaining a positive test result is dependent on whether or not you have a particular condition. If you have a condition, it is more likely that a test result is positive. We can formulate conditional probabilities for any two events in the following way: \\(P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A\\text{ }\\cap\\text{ }B)}{P(B)}\\) \\(P(A ∩ B)\\) In this case, we could have this as: \\[P(positive|disease) = \\frac{P(\\text{positive }\\cap\\text{ disease})}{P(disease)}\\] where ∣ represents “given” and \\(\\cap\\) represents “and”. — Class notes - Text: Summary "],
